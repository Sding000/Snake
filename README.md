## Getting Started

Welcome to the snakegame world. Here is a guideline to help run the game. 

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

Run with:

$ javac App.java
