## Getting Started

Welcome to the snakegame world. Here is a guideline to help run the game. 

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.


## Steps

#### 1. Clone this repo.

#### 2. Navigate into the "src" directory
        $ cd src

#### 2. Run with: 
        $ javac App.java
